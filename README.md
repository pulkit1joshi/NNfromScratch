# NNfromScratch - Neural Network From Scratch
We all use tensorflow , keras , for making convolution layers , dense layers , activations etc. Often people are not sure about what is going in the back , what is the mathematics behind it and how it is implemented. So I have tried to implement Neural Network from scratch and ran it on MNIST dataset. 

### Libraries :

Numpy : Neural Network is implemented using Numpy only.
Matplotlib : Used to view the accuracy of MNIST dataset.
google colab : Trained it using google colab. One may train it on local machine aswell.
